## Summary
All PHS sections have been successfully updated to use the global JS initialization pattern. This ensures that dynamic form features (like adding/removing entries) work correctly after AJAX navigation without requiring a full page reload.

## Technical Details
- All dynamic sections now use partial views (`phs.sections.*-content.blade.php`)
- Controllers return partials for AJAX requests, full views for direct access
- Global initialization functions are defined in `layouts/phs-new.blade.php`
- Placeholder functions prevent errors for sections without dynamic JS
- **Employment History**: If you see raw code, always try deleting and recreating the file as clean UTF-8 with no BOM or hidden characters.

## Update Pattern for Each Section
1. Create partial view in `resources/views/phs/sections/*-content.blade.php`
2. Update controller/route to return partial for AJAX requests
3. Add global initialization function in `layouts/phs-new.blade.php`
4. Add script tag in partial to call global function
5. Test AJAX navigation compatibility
